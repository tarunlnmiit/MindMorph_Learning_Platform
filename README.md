# MindMorph Learning Platform

**Online courses give everyone the same path. MindMorph builds a different one per learner, and won't let you move on until you've proven you understand.**

A multi-agent learning platform built on LangGraph: 16 specialised agents compose into 6 graph workflows that research a topic, draft a personalised skill graph, teach each unit on demand, set exercises, grade your work, and grow the graph around whatever you actually got wrong.

## How it works

    A["Learner goal"] --> B["Orchestrator"]
    B --> C["Scout · Academic · Market · Practical<br/>research the topic"]
    C --> D["Consensus · Reviewer<br/>drafts the skill graph"]

    E --> F["exercise_graph<br/>Exercise + grading"]

    H --> E
    G -->|"score 40-79"| E
    G -->|"score >= 80"| I["Next unit unlocked"]
```

**Progression is gated on demonstrated mastery, not on clicking Next.** `services/mastery.py` scores
each attempt, and the outcome is decided in Python, not the LLM:

- **Score ≥ 80** — mastered. Downstream nodes that depended on it unlock.
- **Score 40–79** — a deliberate no-op. You just retry the node.
- **Score < 40** — the node is locked and the graph grows: an LLM proposes remedial sub-skill nodes,
  inserted as new prerequisites beneath the failed node. Clearing them unlocks it again.

The LLM only ever proposes *what* to add. Adaptation is additive-only — it never renames, reorders, or
deletes an existing node, so a struggling learner never loses progress already made. That invariant is
enforced twice: as a prompt instruction, and mechanically in `apply_adaptation`
(`graph/skill_graph_adapt.py`), which drops edges pointing at unknown ids and refuses to overwrite an
existing node id. If the remediation LLM call fails outright, a `remediation_pending` flag still keeps
the failed node locked — it's never silently left open. Lock state itself isn't stored anywhere; it's
recomputed on every read from the graph plus mastery state (`services/completion.py`), so it can't drift
out of sync.

**Code is graded live, in the browser.** A Monaco editor (`web/components/CodeEditor.tsx`) collects the
submission, `tools/code_executor.py` runs its unit tests in a sandboxed subprocess, and the Reviewer
agent critiques the result — no copy-pasting into a separate terminal. Non-Python exercises and case
studies fall back to LLM rubric grading. A separate, optional in-browser JupyterLite scratchpad
(`web/components/Sandbox.tsx`) is for free experimentation only — the graded submission always goes
through the editor above.

## Architecture notes

- **16 agents, one composition layer.** Agents in `agents/` are single-responsibility and know nothing
  about each other; `graph/` wires them into 6 workflows. Adding a teaching strategy means adding a
  graph, not editing an agent.
- **The vector store is deliberately swappable.** Default is `InMemoryVectorStore` with local `fastembed`
  embeddings, so the platform runs with no vector-DB account and no embedding API cost. Set
  `MINDMORPH_STORE=postgres` and the same interface persists to pgvector. `rag/store.py` and
  `rag/pg_store.py` share one contract — callers never change.
- **Runs with no API key; goes fast when you give it one.** `config.get_chat_model` picks the backend
  and `llm_providers.py` owns the failover. With no keys it is a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
  install — `qwen2.5:7b` for interactive beats (lesson generation, grading, tutor chat, orchestrator
  routing) and `qwen2.5:14b` for reasoning-heavy, once-per-session work (skill-graph consensus, review,
  scout planning). Set `GROQ_API_KEYS` and hosted [Groq](https://groq.com) inference goes in front of
  it: the keys are a pool, and a rate-limited (429), token-capped (413) or rejected (401) key rotates
  to the next one mid-call. Exhaust the pool and it lands on local Ollama rather than failing. A
  *permanent* error — above all a 404 model-not-found — is not rotated: it logs at ERROR and falls
  back immediately, because every key would fail identically.
- **MCP as a tool transport.** `tools/github_mcp_client.py` talks to MCP servers via
  `langchain-mcp-adapters`, with an explicit timeout wrapper in `tools/mcp_timeout.py` — a hung tool call
  can't stall a graph.
- **Postgres is the system of record when durability is on.** SQLAlchemy 2 models under `persistence/`,
  migrations via Alembic, FastAPI routes in `api/`. For local dev, `MINDMORPH_STORE=memory` skips all of
  that and keeps sessions in memory for the process lifetime.

## Run it in two minutes

**No API key required.** Out of the box the LLM is a local Ollama model — no vendor account, no key, no
infra beyond Ollama itself, no Docker, no Postgres, no Alembic, no build step to start. Everything
below works exactly as written with zero credentials.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tarunlnmiit/MindMorph_Learning_Platform.git
cd MindMorph_Learning_Platform

conda create -n mindmorph python=3.11 -y && conda activate mindmorph   # or: python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Ollama (https://ollama.com/download), then pull both tier models
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b

# Backend — zero-infra in-memory store
MINDMORPH_STORE=memory conda run -n mindmorph uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000

# Frontend, in another terminal
cd web && npm install && npm run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:3000`. Sessions live in memory for the process lifetime; see below for the
durable Postgres/RAG setup.

### Optional: hosted inference, for when local is too slow

Local inference is free but slow — a full skill-graph build takes minutes on `qwen2.5:14b`. If you want
speed, put [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) in front of it. It stays optional: remove the keys and
you are back on Ollama with no other change.

```bash
# .env — one or more free-tier keys, comma-separated. Rotation multiplies the per-key quota.
GROQ_API_KEYS=gsk_yourfirstkey,gsk_yoursecondkey,gsk_yourthirdkey
```

That's the whole setup — the provider defaults to `groq` as soon as keys are present, and to `ollama`
when they aren't. Measured on Groq via `scripts/live_smoke.py`: orchestrator routing `0.4–0.8s`, a
seven-node skill-graph consensus build `2.8s`, first tutor token `1.0s`.

Free-tier quota is metered **per key, per model** (for `openai/gpt-oss-120b`: 30 requests/min, 1K
requests/day, 8K tokens/min, 200K tokens/day), which is why the pool exists — five keys is roughly 5x
the headroom. Keep the model on the OpenAI OSS family; Groq has deprecated its Llama models.

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GROQ_API_KEYS` | unset | Comma-separated Groq key pool. Unset → local Ollama only, no key needed |
| `MINDMORPH_LLM_PROVIDER` | `groq` if keys are set, else `ollama` | Primary backend |
| `MINDMORPH_LLM_FALLBACK` | `ollama` | Where a Groq call lands when the pool is exhausted or misconfigured |
| `MINDMORPH_GROQ_MODEL` | `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | Fast tier when Groq is active |
| `MINDMORPH_GROQ_MODEL_COMPLEX` | `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | Quality tier when Groq is active |
| `MINDMORPH_OLLAMA_MODEL` | `qwen2.5:7b` | Fast tier — interactive beats |
| `MINDMORPH_OLLAMA_MODEL_COMPLEX` | `qwen2.5:14b` | Quality tier — reasoning-heavy, once-per-session work |
| `MINDMORPH_OLLAMA_HOST` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama endpoint |
| `MINDMORPH_STORE` | `memory` | `memory` for zero-infra dev, `postgres` for the durable store |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql+psycopg://mindmorph:mindmorph@localhost:5432/mindmorph` | Matches `docker-compose.yml`, used when `MINDMORPH_STORE=postgres` |
| `MINDMORPH_RAG` | off | Toggles knowledge-base retrieval grounding |
| `MINDMORPH_KNOWLEDGE_DIR` | `knowledge_base/` | Corpus loaded into the vector store at startup |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_JUPYTERLITE_URL` | hosted JupyterLite demo | Overrides the in-lesson scratchpad REPL |

For the durable path: `docker compose up -d db && conda run -n mindmorph alembic upgrade head`, then
start the backend without `MINDMORPH_STORE=memory`.

### Programmatic access

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload      # FastAPI routes in api/routes.py
```

## Tests

```bash
MINDMORPH_STORE=memory conda run -n mindmorph python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

## Status

Actively developed, single-user, no auth, no deployment story yet. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` describes a
larger target architecture (Kafka, Kubernetes, Pinecone, multi-tenant) than what currently ships — treat
that document as the roadmap, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` as what's actually built, and this README
as what runs today.
