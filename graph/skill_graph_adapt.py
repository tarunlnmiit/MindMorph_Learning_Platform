"""Phase 3 — deterministic application of a GraphAdaptation to a SkillGraph (no LLM).

The Adaptation agent proposes additive changes; this module applies them under a hard invariant:
adaptation may only ADD new nodes/edges — never rename or delete an existing node id (mastery state
and cached lessons key off node_id). The merge is immutable: it builds a brand-new graph dict and
never mutates the input.

    the inbound edge (or only chains new nodes to each other, e.g. ``setup -> verify`` with neither
    pointing at the graded node) would otherwise lock the node with no completable path — a permanent
    dead end for the learner.

    For a chain of new nodes, only the END of the chain (the node with no outgoing edge to another new
    node — i.e. the "sink") gets wired to the graded node; its predecessors already reach the graded
    node transitively once the sink is connected, so wiring every node individually would add redundant
    edges. Multiple independent new nodes (no edges between them) are each their own one-node chain, so
