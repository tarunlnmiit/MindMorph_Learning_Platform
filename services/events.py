"""Funnel instrumentation — an append-only event timeline on the learning_session (Gate-1 observability).

`COMMERCIALIZATION.md` Gate 1 needs to see *where learners drop off* and *where generated content is
wrong*. Nothing recorded the journey before this — only `ls["usage"]` (cost) and `ls["node_state"]`
(current mastery). Here every loop action appends one structured event to `ls["events"]`; the timeline
is the single source of truth and `funnel_summary` derives the funnel/drop-off/content-quality
aggregates on read. Persists for free in the JSONB session blob (same path as `usage`).

Mirrors the cost pattern (`services/cost.py`): record raw at one chokepoint per stage, aggregate on read.
