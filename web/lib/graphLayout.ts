// Fixed pixel margins, not React Flow's ratio padding. A ratio scales the margin with the frame
// (0.45 ate 173px per side of a 1118px container, ~31% of each axis) which lowers the bbox size at
// which the minZoom clamp engages — the opposite of what a wide graph needs.
// Y is the binding axis: the container is 420px tall against a 136px row pitch (88px card + 48px
// nodesep), so vertical room is what decides how much context fits, and every pixel spent on the
// vertical margin costs framed rows.

// natural fit drops under minZoom the clamp holds zoom at 0.5 and `getViewportForBounds` throws the
// requested padding away, so the frame loses its entire margin budget and cards just outside the
// focus box get sliced by the container edge. Keeping the fit above this floor means the clamp never
// engages and the margin is always really applied. It is deliberately NOT a readability threshold:
// 0.6 renders a 14px label at 8.4px, small but no smaller than the whole-graph view this page
// already fits at mount. Raise it if a browser pass says the cue is unreadable — the cost is context
// (fewer cards framed), never a clipped frame.

/**
 * Which nodes the rewire camera should frame.
 *
 * A fixed hop count can't hold across graph sizes: two hops off a mid-graph node is five cards on a
 * young path, but on a mature one — where every high score has added an unlock edge reaching several
 * ranks downstream — it sweeps most of the map, the natural fit falls under minZoom, and the frame
 * clips. So take the first hop unconditionally (the new nodes plus what they attach to — the minimum
 * that reads as a connected change, and bounded because a remedial node has exactly one edge), then
 * keep widening only while the set still fits at `FOCUS_MIN_ZOOM`. Small graphs get more context, big
 * ones less, and the frame is legible either way.
 *
 * The last hop is taken PARTIALLY rather than dropped, because a whole hop on a dense graph is a jump
 * from three cards to an entire rank — refusing it outright would swap one cliff for another and land
 * the mature-graph case back on the three-cards framing the fixed two hops were written to avoid.
