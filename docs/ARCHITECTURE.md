## 1. Product Vision

Today's learning landscape is fragmented: AI chatbots are text-heavy and lack guided hands-on
experience; Coursera/Udemy are expensive and one-size-fits-all; YouTube is unstructured passive
content; corporate training is static and outdated. **MindMorph** is an AI-powered personal learning
coach built to make learning effective, engaging, and directly tied to real-world outcomes.

### Four Core Principles

1. **Deep Personalization at Scale** — generates a unique learning path per user, adapting to their
   background, current skill level, and ultimate career/personal goals, even incorporating the
   user's own study materials.
2. **Practical, Application-First Learning** — focus on doing, not watching; every lesson builds
   job-ready skills through hands-on exercises, real-world examples, and interactive simulations.
3. **Total Flexibility for Any Schedule** — from quick 5-min "Boosts," 20-min "Builders," and
   2-hour "Sprints" to comprehensive structured courses, all guided by an ever-present AI Teaching
   Assistant.
4. **A Future-Proof Learning Ecosystem** — long-term: multi-language support, live 1:1 tutoring,
   and community features.

## 2. MVP Scope

Validate the core value proposition with foundational features on a single high-impact subject.

- **MVP target subject:** AI and Machine Learning fundamentals (beginners → experts).

### Core User Journeys (single intuitive prompt drives both)

- **Journey A — On-the-Spot Skill Boosts (immediate needs):** learn a specific topic quickly.
  Formats: **5-min Boosts**, **20-min Builders**, **2-hour Sprints**.
- **Journey B — Structured Learning Paths (long-term transformation):** comprehensive knowledge for
  a larger goal (career change, starting a business). The plan is personalized to the user's total
  available time and adapts daily, mixing micro-lessons with deeper dives.

### Key MVP Features

- **Seamless onboarding & deep personalization** — social sign-in (LinkedIn, Gmail), conversational
  goal assessment. For vague self-assessments, an optional **Dynamic Skill Assessment** (MCQs /
  interactive tasks) pinpoints the starting level. Users can **upload their own materials** (PDFs,
  notes, links), which are ingested and vectorized as a high-priority source.
- **Hyper-personalized learning plan** — a visual **Skill Dependency Graph** (the most efficient
  path to the goal). A living document that adapts to actual progress (condensing/expanding
  timelines).
- **Dynamic content engine** — multi-faceted lesson experience: **The Hook** (trending insight),
  **Explainers** (text + custom diagrams), **Real-World Examples** (live web-sourced case studies),
  hands-on simulations and step-by-step guides.
- **AI Teaching Assistant** — always-on, full awareness of the user's plan, progress, and history;
  can modify the plan, answer questions, give feedback, in chat **and voice** modes.
- **Automated grading & feedback** — instant feedback; coding challenges graded via **unit tests**,
  design/analytical tasks via a detailed **LLM rubric** (users can upload artifacts).
- **Screen Vision & Browser Automation agents** — for hands-on exercises requiring an external
  tool/website: the Screen Vision Agent sees the user's screen; the Browser Automation Agent
  highlights buttons and guides the user.

## 3. How It Works — The Generation Engine

### 3.1 Learning Graph Generation

Multi-step, agent-driven. Multiple LLMs generate a robust but generic baseline **Skill Graph**.
Specialist agents then enrich and validate it:

- **Academic Agent** — checks it against university curricula.
- **Market & Trends Agent** — adds the latest in-demand skills from job sites.
- **Practical Implementation Agent** — links skills to real-world projects (e.g., GitHub).

Output: a hyper-personalized roadmap.

### 3.2 Course Content Generation (dual-path)

- **Path A** — an LLM generates a creative, well-structured draft.
- **Path B** — AI agents perform live web searches for factually accurate, timely data (diagrams
  from university courses, case studies from blogs).
- A final **"Master" LLM** synthesizes the creative draft with the factual data → engaging,
  accurate, up-to-the-minute content.

### 3.3 Practical Component Generation

After a lesson, agents fetch the best raw materials from the live web (code from GitHub, case
studies from tech blogs). A final LLM synthesizes these into a unique exercise, rewriting/adapting
it to the user's specific role and goals.

## 4. Architecture Overview

MindMorph operates as a **network of modular, AI-augmented services** communicating via lightweight
APIs and event streams. Six layers: **user experience, orchestration, intelligence, data,
operations, analytics**.

### 4.1 Architecture Objective

Enable a scalable, adaptive, continuously improving AI learning platform that merges human teaching
with generative intelligence. Five core outcomes:

1. **Adaptive Learning Delivery** — content aligned to pace, skill, interests via AI personalization.
2. **Reliable & Observable Operations** — high availability, measurable latency, full request→response traceability.
3. **Model & Vendor Flexibility** — dynamically route to the most cost-effective / contextually suited LLM (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Bedrock).
4. **Continuous Improvement Loop** — real-time telemetry, analytics, and human feedback refine prompts, models, content.
5. **Global-Scale Security & Compliance** — data privacy, secure API access, region-aware deployment as first-class concerns.

### 4.2 Interaction Loop

Not a rigid hierarchy — an **interactive loop**:

```
Learner Interaction → Application Orchestration → AI/LLM Generation → Data Storage & Context Retrieval
                                  ↑                                                  │
                                  └──────────  Analytics & Feedback Systems  ◄───────┘
            (insights flow back to update prompts, models, and personalization policies)
```

### 4.3 Architectural Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Modular & Observable** | Each component runs independently with unified monitoring/tracing — rapid iteration without losing visibility. |
| **AI-First Abstraction** | Business logic isolated from model logic via orchestration/routing layers — model/vendor swaps with minimal code impact. |
| **Continuous Learning Loop** | Data and analytics inform prompt, model, and content evolution. |
